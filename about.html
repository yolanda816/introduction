<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Hui Zhao. I come from China.  I am currently in the process of obtaining an certificate of 
    Web and Development. This semester should wrap up the Web Development classes for the time being, but I am also 
    taking javascript and PHP classes.  I do have a bachelorâ€™s degree in fashion design, and I 
    worked for a fashion company for 3 years. I enjoy web development a lot more than my previous,
    so I'm very excited to move on to something I'm better suited for. This class seems like it has a lot to offer so 
    I'm looking forward to learning all that I can. </p>
